### Ahoy there! ðŸš€

I'm Mezbaul, currently diving deep into the academic ocean at [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) for my Masters, while also tinkering away at [Bongo](https://www.bongobd.com/) in my spare moments.

Currently venturing into the realms of **Recommendation Systems**, **Search Engines**, **BCI Tech**, **Generative AI** (particularly **LLM**), and **Robotics**.

Feel free to journey through my open-source universe here on GitHub or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mezbaul-h/).

Wishing you a fantastic day filled with coding escapades! ðŸŒŸ
